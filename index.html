            Thank you UX studio for the intensive 3-day training. It was markedly useful that we could progress in a personalised manner, with the topics related to our company. We were able to experience the values of the presented UX methodologies and mentality on our own skin.

            The ratio of theoretical and practical parts was perfectly proportioned. We wanted to bring practical UX experience to the team, so we were glad to be ‘pushed into’ live interviews with users! It was really life-like.
